Hey there, pal! Boy, am I glad to see you. I lost my favorite book, and I could really use someone's help in getting it back. I know it's somewhere in this house, but I'm stuck in here! Think you'd be willing to lend a hand?

Now for all of you intrigued spectators that have tuned in to this spectacular treasure hunt, now it is your turn to look away. Thanks very much.
<br/>
J, <br/><br/> Happy Birthday! I simply can't believe you're 13. That's a little too much for me, honestly. But... happy birthday anyway, I guess. ^_^. Either way, I hope you enjoyed this fun little game! It would've been too easy to just GIVE you a present--no way. I had to make it difficult for you, of course. <br/><br/> I want you to know that as you step out of your world and start to figure out who you are, you've always got a friend along the way. I may get angry and snippy sometimes, but that never means I won't be there for you. <br/><br/> I hope you've had an incredible birthday! You are an incredible guy, seriously. <br/><br/> Love,<br/> Shayla. <br/><br/> P.S. You want to know why I couldn't play Minecraft Dungeons with you this last week? I was working my BUTT off trying to finish this in time! And I couldn't even tell you!
